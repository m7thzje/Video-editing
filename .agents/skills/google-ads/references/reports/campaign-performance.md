# Campaign Performance

Time-series view of spend, clicks, conversions, and ROAS per campaign.
The general-purpose performance dashboard — pair with the diagnosis
reports when an issue surfaces.

## When to use

- "How is each campaign performing over time?"
- Weekly / monthly performance review with the client.
- Identifying trend changes (sudden spend spike, conversion drop).
- The default first dashboard for a new client engagement.

## Inputs

- `customer_id` (required).
- `date_range` (default: `LAST_30_DAYS`).
- Optional: `campaign_ids` filter.

Use the GAQL below through `google_ads_gaql_query` for both ad-hoc
reporting and refreshable dashboards.

## GAQL

```sql
SELECT
  segments.date,
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  campaign.advertising_channel_type,
  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value,
  metrics.ctr,
  metrics.average_cpc
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
  AND campaign.status != 'REMOVED'
```

## How to interpret

- Daily ROAS = `conversions_value / cost`. Plot as time series; a
  step-down on a known date often correlates with an ad / landing-page
  change.
- A sustained drop in conversions with steady spend = tracking issue
  or seasonality, not necessarily campaign decay.
- Compare campaigns of the same `advertising_channel_type`; cross-type
  comparisons (Search vs PMax) are misleading.

## Variants

- Add `metrics.search_impression_share` and
  `metrics.search_top_impression_share` to spot lost-by-budget /
  lost-by-rank issues.
- Group by `segments.device` for desktop vs mobile vs tablet splits.
