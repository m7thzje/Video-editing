# Account Overview

Full-account health snapshot. Combines spend, conversions, conversion
rate, and cost per conversion in a single dashboard so the agent can
orient before drilling into a specific issue.

## When to use

- "How is the account doing?"
- First report to run for a new client engagement.
- Periodic health check.
- When routing to a more focused report (tracking / budget / search
  terms / structure) requires an aggregate baseline.

## Inputs

- `customer_id` (required).
- `date_range` (default: `LAST_30_DAYS`).

Use the GAQL below through `google_ads_gaql_query` for both ad-hoc
reporting and refreshable dashboards.

## GAQL

```sql
SELECT
  segments.date,
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  campaign.status,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
  AND campaign.status != 'REMOVED'
```

## How to interpret

- Treat any campaign with significant spend and zero conversions over a
  meaningful window as a tracking-or-budget issue, not a "campaign
  performance" issue.
- ROAS and CPA are downstream signals — surface them only when
  conversion tracking is verified (see
  [conversion-tracking.md](conversion-tracking.md)).
- Aggregate spend without segmenting by date hides pacing problems;
  always include a daily series.

## Variants

- Add `metrics.average_cpc`, `metrics.ctr`, `metrics.search_impression_share`
  to the GAQL when the user wants efficiency context.
- Group by `campaign.advertising_channel_type` to split Search / PMax /
  Display in the same dashboard.
