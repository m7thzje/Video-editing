# Search Terms Waste

Search terms report showing query-level cost, clicks, conversions, and
conversion value.

## When to use

- "What search terms are getting spend?"
- "Which search terms converted?"
- "Show search terms by campaign/ad group."
- Before discussing negatives, inspect the actual search-term evidence.

## Inputs

- `customer_id` (required).
- `date_range` (default: `LAST_30_DAYS`).
- Optional: `campaign_ids` to scope.
- Threshold: cost-without-conversion floor (default: $10 / 10_000_000
  micros over the window).

Use the GAQL below through `google_ads_gaql_query` for both ad-hoc
reporting and refreshable dashboards.

## GAQL

```sql
SELECT
  search_term_view.search_term,
  search_term_view.status,
  campaign.name,
  ad_group.name,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value
FROM search_term_view
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
```

## How to interpret

- Highest spend with zero conversions over a meaningful window = top
  candidates for negatives.
- Off-intent terms (job seekers when you sell software, "free" when you
  sell paid, competitor names you don't want to bid on) deserve
  campaign- or account-level negatives, not ad-group-level.
- A single ad group surfacing many wasteful themes signals a structural
  problem; pair with [campaign-structure.md](campaign-structure.md).

## Variants

- Group by theme (regex patterns over `search_term`) to surface
  thematic waste rather than per-query waste.
- Add `metrics.average_cpc` to spot expensive-per-click terms even
  when total spend is small.
