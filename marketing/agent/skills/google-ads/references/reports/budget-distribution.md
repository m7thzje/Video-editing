# Budget Distribution

Where spend is actually going across campaigns.

## When to use

- "Where is our budget going?"
- "Which campaigns are wasting money?"
- Pacing review before adjusting daily budgets.

## Inputs

- `customer_id` (required).
- `date_range` (default: `LAST_30_DAYS`).

Use the GAQL below through `google_ads_gaql_query` for both ad-hoc
reporting and refreshable dashboards.

## GAQL

```sql
SELECT
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  campaign.status,
  campaign_budget.amount_micros,
  campaign_budget.delivery_method,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value,
  metrics.clicks
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
  AND campaign.status != 'REMOVED'
```

## How to interpret

- High `cost_micros` + zero `conversions` over a meaningful window =
  immediate candidate for budget reduction OR for a tracking audit.
  Don't recommend cuts until tracking is ruled out.
- Spend Herfindahl: if 80%+ of spend lives in 2–3 campaigns, the
  account is concentrated; restructure work has high leverage.
- Compare `cost_micros` to `campaign_budget.amount_micros * days` to
  detect under-pacing (budget caps / bidding ceilings).

## Variants

- Add `metrics.search_impression_share` to flag campaigns that are
  budget-constrained vs. competitor-pressured.
- Group by `campaign.advertising_channel_type` to compare Search vs
  PMax vs Display efficiency separately.
