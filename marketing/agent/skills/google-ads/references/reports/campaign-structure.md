# Campaign Structure

Campaign and ad-group structure view for understanding where spend,
clicks, and conversions sit across account organization.

## When to use

- "Show me campaign and ad group structure."
- "Which ad groups are getting spend?"
- "How are campaigns and ad groups performing together?"
- Before launching a parallel campaign, inspect whether the existing
  account already covers the same theme.

## Inputs

- `customer_id` (required).
- `date_range` (default: `LAST_30_DAYS`).

Use the GAQL below through `google_ads_gaql_query` for both ad-hoc
reporting and refreshable dashboards.

## GAQL

```sql
SELECT
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  campaign.advertising_channel_type,
  ad_group.id,
  ad_group.name,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.impressions
FROM ad_group
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
  AND campaign.status != 'REMOVED'
  AND ad_group.status != 'REMOVED'
```

## How to interpret

- One campaign carrying many ad groups with very different conversion
  rates → segmentation candidates.
- Brand-matching ad groups inside the same campaign as generic
  non-brand ad groups → recommend a brand split (huge bidding leverage).
- Ad groups with very low impression share inside high-spend campaigns
  → likely competing internally with another ad group; consolidation
  candidates.

## Variants

- Filter to `campaign.advertising_channel_type = 'SEARCH'` for
  search-only restructure analysis.
- Add `ad_group.type` to distinguish standard vs PMax asset groups.
