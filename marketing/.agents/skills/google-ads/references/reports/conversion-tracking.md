# Conversion Tracking

Conversion-action inventory report. Use it to list configured
conversion actions and their metadata before building action-specific
dashboards.

## When to use

- "Which conversion actions exist?"
- "Which conversion actions are enabled?"
- "What are the conversion action categories and settings?"
- Before building a funnel dashboard that needs user-mapped stages.

## Inputs

- `customer_id` (required).

Use the GAQL below through `google_ads_gaql_query` when you need
conversion-action metadata. This is separate from campaign-level
conversion metrics, which use `segments.conversion_action*`.

## GAQL

```sql
SELECT
  conversion_action.id,
  conversion_action.name,
  conversion_action.category,
  conversion_action.type,
  conversion_action.status,
  conversion_action.primary_for_goal,
  conversion_action.counting_type,
  conversion_action.click_through_lookback_window_days
FROM conversion_action
WHERE conversion_action.status != 'REMOVED'
```

## How to interpret

- **No enabled conversion actions** → optimization is blind; halt all
  Smart Bidding advice until at least one is configured.
- **Multiple `PRIMARY_FOR_GOAL` actions in the same category** (e.g. two
  primary purchase actions) → Smart Bidding double-counts; recommend
  demoting one to secondary.
- **`PURCHASE` category but `counting_type = MANY_PER_CLICK`** is rare
  and usually a misconfiguration; flag for review.
- **Lookback window mismatches** between online + offline actions can
  produce inconsistent attribution.

## Variants

- Join with the `conversion-by-action.md` cache table to overlay actual
  conversion volume on each action's setup status.
- Filter to `category = 'PURCHASE'` for ecommerce-only audits.
