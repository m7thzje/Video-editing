# Conversion Funnel

Multi-stage conversion funnel for lead-gen / B2B accounts. Pivots
per-action conversion data into ordered funnel stages and computes
step-conversion rates between stages.

## When to use

- Lead-gen / B2B accounts with multiple sequential stages (e.g.
  application_submitted → lead_reached → scheduled → showed → won).
- "What's the drop-off between [stage A] and [stage B]?"
- "Which stage is the bottleneck?"
- Pricing or onboarding optimization rooted in funnel data.

For a flat per-action breakdown without ordering, use
[conversion-by-action.md](conversion-by-action.md) instead.

## Inputs

- `customer_id` (required).
- `date_range` (default: `LAST_30_DAYS`).
- An ordered list of conversion-action names (or IDs) that defines the
  funnel. **The agent must discover these first** — no funnel ordering
  is hard-coded.

## GAQL

### Step 1 — discover the user's conversion actions

```sql
SELECT
  conversion_action.id,
  conversion_action.name,
  conversion_action.category,
  conversion_action.status
FROM conversion_action
WHERE conversion_action.status != 'REMOVED'
```

Show the result to the user and ask them to map each action to a funnel
stage in order. **Do not assume a six-stage funnel** (or any stage count) —
funnels are workspace-specific.

### Step 2 — pull per-action data

Same shape as [conversion-by-action.md](conversion-by-action.md):

```sql
SELECT
  segments.date,
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  segments.conversion_action,
  segments.conversion_action_name,
  segments.conversion_action_category,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.all_conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
  AND campaign.status != 'REMOVED'
```

The same caveat applies: **only** segment via
`segments.conversion_action*`, never `conversion_action.id` against
`FROM campaign` (raises `PROHIBITED_RESOURCE_TYPE_IN_SELECT_CLAUSE`).
The metric is `metrics.conversions`, not the nonexistent
`metrics.conversions_by_conversion_action`.

Do **not** include `metrics.cost_micros` in the per-action query. Google Ads
rejects cost with `segments.conversion_action*` using
`PROHIBITED_SEGMENT_WITH_METRIC_IN_SELECT_OR_WHERE_CLAUSE`. If cost is needed,
run a separate campaign/date query:

```sql
SELECT
  segments.date,
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.impressions
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
  AND campaign.status != 'REMOVED'
```

Join conversion rows to cost rows on `(segments.date, campaign.id)`. For
one-off analysis, join in memory with pandas or an equivalent dataframe in the
sandbox; cache tables are only needed for dashboard/data-app builds.

## How to interpret

- Pivot the raw rows so each user-mapped stage becomes a column,
  values are stage totals.
- Step conversion rate = `stage_n / stage_n-1`.
- Joined cost is campaign/date context. Do not present it as action-attributed
  cost per stage unless the report explicitly defines an allocation rule.
- State the user-provided stage mapping in the final report. Do not
  infer action order from names alone.

## Building a dashboard from this report

```python
# After the agent has mapped action names to ordered stages, e.g.
# stages = ["application_submitted", "lead_reached",
#           "scheduled_for_training", "showed_for_training",
#           "launched_from_training", "rep_that_sells"]

## Variants

- **Step rates**: add an `sql_data_sources` entry that uses window
  functions (`LAG`) to compute `conversions / lag_conversions` between
  ordered stages and bind it to a separate KPI row.
- **Per campaign**: filter `WHERE campaign.id = ...` to compare funnel
  shapes between campaigns.
- **Allocated cost per stage**: join campaign/date cost to conversion rows,
  then apply an explicit allocation rule before presenting stage cost.
